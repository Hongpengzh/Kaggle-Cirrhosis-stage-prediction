## Background
A hospital has hired you to develop a machine learning model to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis in their patients. Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. The features they have available consist of a mix of continuous and categorical variables and it is your job to select which features will get you the best results.

## Data description
1) index: unique identifier
2) N_Days: number of days between registration and the earlier of death, transplantation, or study analysis time in July 1986
3) Status: status of the patient C (censored), CL (censored due to liver tx), or D (death)
4) Drug: type of drug D-penicillamine or placebo
5) Age: age in [days]
6) Sex: M (male) or F (female)
7) Ascites: presence of ascites N (No) or Y (Yes)
8) Hepatomegaly: presence of hepatomegaly N (No) or Y (Yes)
9) Spiders: presence of spiders N (No) or Y (Yes)
10) Edema: presence of edema N (no edema and no diuretic therapy for edema), S (edema present without diuretics, or edema resolved by diuretics), or Y (edema despite diuretic therapy)
11) Bilirubin: serum bilirubin in [mg/dl]
12) Cholesterol: serum cholesterol in [mg/dl]
13) Albumin: albumin in [gm/dl]
14) Copper: urine copper in [ug/day]
15) Alk_Phos: alkaline phosphatase in [U/liter]
16) SGOT: SGOT in [U/ml]
17) Triglycerides: triglicerides in [mg/dl]
18) Platelets: platelets per cubic [ml/1000]
19) Prothrombin: prothrombin time in seconds [s]
20) Stage: histologic stage of disease (1, 2, 3, or 4)
